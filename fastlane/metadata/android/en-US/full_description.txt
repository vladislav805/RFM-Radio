**RFM Radio** - real radio (not online, not require Internet), that uses real hardware radio for Android smartphones based on Qualcomm Snapdragon processors.

> Currently supported ONLY smartphones with Qualcomm Snapdragon (except >=632 and >=820). Supported models see [here](https://github.com/vladislav805/Spirit3-FM/#%D0%BE%D1%84%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%BE-%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B5%D1%82). 

**Note:** though the app itself is covered by the GPL, there are 3 Qualcomm files (native platform specific routines to program the V4L2 driver for FM) used which are not.

**Capabilities:**

* Listening to the radio.
* Reading RDS - PS and RT.
* Display the signal strength in dB.
* Radio recording in .wav files.
* Saving favorite frequencies with name.
* Ability to create multiple favorites lists.
* Automatic search for radio stations.
